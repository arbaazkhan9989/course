classes, so that's about like

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/53-1

sleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/89-0
00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:48.169

For weekdays.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/94-0
00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:52.165
Yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/103-0
00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:56.405
Umm, average sleeping time must
be.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/115-0
00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.835
For five hours 2:00 AM. Too
late.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/113-0
00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:00.415
Like.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/118-0
00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:02.585
Sorry.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/120-0
00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:04.615
Here you go.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/131-0
00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.255
So somewhere around 2:00 to 3:00
AM to.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/137-0
00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:12.565
It's 8:00 to 10:00 AM.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/141-0
00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:16.035
And we on weekends.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/151-0
00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:21.015
On weekends, it's it, it's it's
quite like.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/165-0
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:26.505
It it depends. Sometimes
weekends I don't get any sleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/182-0
00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:32.272
And sometimes it's just like
straight up 1212 hours of sleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/182-1
00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:34.175
It's it's quite different.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/197-0
00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:39.538
How do you usually feel when you
wake up in the morning? Do you

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/197-1
00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:40.785
feel refreshed or tired?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/205-0
00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:44.085
I feel tired most of the times.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/216-0
00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:50.766
And like are there like do you
wanna like talk more about that

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/216-1
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:51.165
thing?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/274-0
00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:58.520
Yeah. So usually when I wake up,
I'm pretty much tired. I'm

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/274-1
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.735
groggy, there's little to no
energy in me. I have to push

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/274-2
00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:09.041
myself, and I mostly run on
caffeine. I will either need a

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/274-3
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:14.436
cup of coffee or a cup of tea to
begin my day so that I can

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/274-4
00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:16.415
sustain the whole day.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/287-0
00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:22.436
What are some of the factors
that impact your ability to fall

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/287-1
00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:22.855
asleep?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/319-0
00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:29.883
Well, a lot of times I find
myself just randomly scrolling

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/319-1
00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:34.025
on social media, even if I'm
sleepy, I tend to just keep

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/319-2
00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:37.805
using my phone, and then when I
try to fall asleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/339-0
00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:44.879
Usually I can't. Secondly, I do
struggle with the random

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/339-1
00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.015
thoughts. I get anxious and
hence I can't sleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/376-0
00:02:51.115 --> 00:02:56.213
Other than that, even if I have
like done physical strain and

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/376-1
00:02:56.213 --> 00:03:01.311
sexercises and at the end I'm
tired but I want to sleep but I

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/376-2
00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:06.409
can't basically fall asleep. So
these are certain things that

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/376-3
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.725
affect my sleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/375-0
00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:07.565
And.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/378-0
00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:08.425
Girl.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/405-0
00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:12.380
OK. Can you talk about like,
what's the like, the factors

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/405-1
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.732
that impact your ability to stay
asleep? It can be like noise,

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/405-2
00:03:15.732 --> 00:03:17.275
light or something, you know?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/420-0
00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:22.916
Umm yeah, I am pretty much a
light sleeper so any sort of

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/420-1
00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:23.365
noise.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/429-0
00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:27.475
If my phone vibrates, I will
wake up.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/465-0
00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:33.140
Or if if, since I sleep
sometimes early in the morning

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/465-1
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.416
like 6-7 o'clock if I'm sleeping
at that time I can hear birds

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/465-2
00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:43.357
chirping and that's another
thing that makes it harder for

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/465-3
00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:44.865
me to fall asleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/495-0
00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:50.459
And like, uh, can you talk about
the distractions that you have?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/495-1
00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.576
Like when you was like, when you
fell asleep and the distractions

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/495-2
00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:57.695
like iron, it can be a
notifications your screen.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/504-0
00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:00.685
Out on the light in the room or
something.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/529-0
00:04:02.215 --> 00:04:06.647
Mainly it's the phone buzzing.
It's the notification that if

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/529-1
00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:11.225
I'm trying to fall asleep, if my
phone buzzes, I will wake up.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/546-0
00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:16.796
Have you ever experienced any
negative effects of lack of

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/546-1
00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:19.970
sleep such as difficulty
concentrating or feeling

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/546-2
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.605
irritable?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/567-0
00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:28.082
Yes, that is on most days when I
have not slept well, I will be

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/567-1
00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:32.005
super tired. I will be very
irritable.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/586-0
00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:37.159
Why? What when I attend classes
so half of the time I am not

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/586-1
00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.345
even present in the class. I
can't concentrate and I can't.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/601-0
00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:45.853
Umm, I got like I can't focus
and I I I just feel like

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/601-1
00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:47.625
sleeping in the class.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/603-0
00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:50.265
Right.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/626-0
00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:54.709
Have you ever used an app or
other technology to help you

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/626-1
00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:58.494
improve your sleep and habits?
If so, what was your experience

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/626-2
00:04:58.494 --> 00:04:58.795
like?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/635-0
00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:03.545
Umm, I did use this app called
calm.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/648-0
00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:10.416
Umm for the first few tries I
couldn't manage to sleep a

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/648-1
00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:11.635
little bit.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/659-0
00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:17.865
But nothing, nothing more than
two to three hours.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/673-0
00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:24.335
And then I have tried sleeping
music which is available on

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/673-1
00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:25.045
YouTube.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/700-0
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:31.922
And I mean it does give me a
good nap, but that just lasts

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/700-1
00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:37.425
for like, say, 3040 minutes. And
yeah, that's about it.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/717-0
00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:42.998
And do you have any specific
method methods like how you fall

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/717-1
00:05:42.998 --> 00:05:45.525
asleep, how you make for
yourself, fall asleep?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/731-0
00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:51.925
I mean, are you asking if I have
any techniques to?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/733-0
00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:52.415
Yeah, what button?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/748-0
00:05:53.825 --> 00:06:01.255
OK. So I mean, if I'm already in
bed, I would just try to.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/750-0
00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:03.105
You know.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/805-0
00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:09.215
Count anticlockwise, that is one
of the methods that I tried to

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/805-1
00:06:09.215 --> 00:06:13.989
fall asleep. Another is I will
do some breathing work. It goes

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/805-2
00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:18.839
something like 2 inhales and one
long exhale. That is something

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/805-3
00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:23.613
that I try to fall asleep and
other than that during the day I

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/805-4
00:06:23.613 --> 00:06:25.735
would I will try to sort of.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/829-0
00:06:27.135 --> 00:06:32.012
In Colgate, any sort of exercise
throughout their day, some sort

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/829-1
00:06:32.012 --> 00:06:36.365
of physical work that even if
it's like going for a walk.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/857-0
00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:41.925
It sometimes does help me to
fall asleep, but it's just it

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/857-1
00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:46.689
depends from day-to-day it it
will work on some days and it it

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/857-2
00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.655
doesn't work on most days.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/869-0
00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:53.132
Alright. Do you have any
specific goals related to

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/869-1
00:06:53.132 --> 00:06:54.625
improving your sleep habits?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/912-0
00:06:56.155 --> 00:07:01.327
Umm yeah, I do have. I mean, I
want to have a good sleeping

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/912-1
00:07:01.327 --> 00:07:07.016
schedule so that I don't have to
depend on caffeine. I don't have

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/912-2
00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:12.361
to. I don't. I just in general,
I want to sleep well. Cause I

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/912-3
00:07:12.361 --> 00:07:15.465
know on days when I get good
sleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/951-0
00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:20.834
Uh, I feel so much better and I
get so, so much done. My

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/951-1
00:07:20.834 --> 00:07:26.341
productivity increases, so yeah,
that's that's one thing that if

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/951-2
00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:31.340
in any way if I can fix my
sleeping schedule, it will be a

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/951-3
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.035
game changer for me.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/968-0
00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:37.738
What features would you like to
see in an app designed to

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/968-1
00:07:37.738 --> 00:07:39.245
promote healthy sleep habits?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/971-0
00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:42.005
Umm.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/990-0
00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:49.288
Some features that I think that
might help me personally would

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/990-1
00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:52.525
be certain reminders of for say.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1003-0
00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:58.955
Well, for example, keeping your
phone down right before the bed

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1003-1
00:07:58.955 --> 00:07:59.815
and like.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1014-0
00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:06.361
Reminders to stay hydrated cause
I think that also sort of helps

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1014-1
00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:06.695
you.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1034-0
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:13.384
Umm, other features would be
some soothing sounds that can

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1034-1
00:08:13.384 --> 00:08:17.475
help you to put put yourself to
sleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1064-0
00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:24.037
Some some calming painting
exercises if if you can add

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1064-1
00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:29.557
cause that also sort of works.
These are something some

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1064-2
00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:33.205
features that are on top of my
mind.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1074-0
00:08:34.505 --> 00:08:37.215
How do you concurrently wake up?
Is it through alarms?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1076-0
00:08:38.335 --> 00:08:38.715
Yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1086-0
00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:42.595
And do you have do you set
multiple alarms? Would they?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1099-0
00:08:42.965 --> 00:08:47.295
Yeah, I do set multiple alarms
and I tend to snooze them.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1106-0
00:08:48.675 --> 00:08:51.275
Yeah, and how effective do you
think they are?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1110-0
00:08:53.055 --> 00:08:54.705
Setting multiple alarms.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1114-0
00:08:55.855 --> 00:08:56.195
Yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1117-0
00:08:56.065 --> 00:08:57.455
So it's sort of.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1133-0
00:08:58.265 --> 00:09:02.735
Disrupts my sleep so that I am
half half awake half asleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1137-0
00:09:03.465 --> 00:09:05.515
And then it just.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1156-0
00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:11.461
I mean it is irritating, but at
the end it pushes me to get out

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1156-1
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:13.335
of bed so it just helps.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1173-0
00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.825
How are you important? Is it to
you to wake feeling refreshed

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1173-1
00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.215
and energized in the morning?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1180-0
00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:23.705
It's extremely important for me
because.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1195-0
00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:30.672
On days when I do wake up
feeling refreshed, I get so much

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1195-1
00:09:30.672 --> 00:09:32.845
done. My productivity is.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1198-0
00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:34.585
Very high.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1213-0
00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:41.097
Umm. And I think that shows on
every single aspect of my life.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1213-1
00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:41.865
So yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1244-0
00:09:45.495 --> 00:09:49.203
Do you have? Do you have any
concerns about using technology

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1244-1
00:09:49.203 --> 00:09:52.425
such as machine learning,
artificial intelligence or

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1244-2
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.891
biometric sensors to improve
your sleep? If so, what are

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1244-3
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:56.195
they?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1255-0
00:09:57.425 --> 00:10:01.645
Umm, no, I I don't think so. I
don't have any issues.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1271-0
00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:07.144
Can you do you think you can
rely on these things like just

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1271-1
00:10:07.144 --> 00:10:07.965
like somehow?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1282-0
00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:14.575
Umm are you saying if I can rely
on apps to fall asleep?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1284-0
00:10:15.425 --> 00:10:15.815
Yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1322-0
00:10:17.305 --> 00:10:23.145
Yeah, I think if if if it is, it
can be a facilitator wherein you

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1322-1
00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:28.454
take help of it and try to
figure out your triggers and you

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1322-2
00:10:28.454 --> 00:10:32.525
know try to solve them and then
you can just.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1338-0
00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:39.322
Take help of it whenever and if
necessary, so I think it's a

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1338-1
00:10:39.322 --> 00:10:41.065
good way to start.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1379-0
00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:46.021
Or what if like I imagine, a
scenario where you have a

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1379-1
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.287
specific, let's assume Apple
Watch and it's striking your

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1379-2
00:10:49.287 --> 00:10:52.834
sleep cycle, but eventually it
wasn't able to track your sleep

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1370-0
00:10:50.435 --> 00:10:51.045
Umm.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1379-3
00:10:52.834 --> 00:10:53.735
cycle correctly.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1381-0
00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:54.775
Umm.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1395-0
00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:57.409
And it was giving you the
information which wasn't

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1395-1
00:10:57.409 --> 00:10:58.845
correct. So what about that?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1404-0
00:11:00.565 --> 00:11:05.235
Umm yeah. I mean that would be
an issue.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1426-0
00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:12.156
But on most days I think I I
could rely on an app because I

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1426-1
00:11:12.156 --> 00:11:13.805
have used these apps.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1428-0
00:11:15.365 --> 00:11:15.685
Sorry.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1445-0
00:11:16.455 --> 00:11:19.922
What are some of the challenges
you face when it comes to

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1432-0
00:11:16.535 --> 00:11:16.975
Yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1445-1
00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:21.955
maintaining healthy sleep
habits?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1454-0
00:11:24.705 --> 00:11:29.135
Challenges. Ohh. The main
challenges.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1480-0
00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:35.996
Actually, sticking to the
schedule that you have made for

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1480-1
00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:42.166
yourself, like implementing is
the issue. That's the main thing

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1480-2
00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:43.805
you can't really.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1481-0
00:11:43.405 --> 00:11:44.105
And leave.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1500-0
00:11:45.495 --> 00:11:48.835
Can you explain it like why is
it hard to maintain like those

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1485-0
00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:46.065
Yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1500-1
00:11:48.835 --> 00:11:51.045
things and the challenges that
you face?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1531-0
00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:57.359
There are a lot of external
factors as well. Like sometimes

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1531-1
00:11:57.359 --> 00:12:01.681
you wanna hang out with your
friends or you've got any

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1531-2
00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:05.375
deadlines. So you, you you stay
up doing that.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1537-0
00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:08.445
Sometimes it's just.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1540-0
00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:10.115
Well, yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1565-0
00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:15.768
Me on days like when you're
you're feeling anxious or you

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1565-1
00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:20.850
you have multiple thoughts in
your head. You can't sleep. And

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1565-2
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.735
I think these are some.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1588-0
00:12:23.435 --> 00:12:28.979
Problems and like these are some
external factors that I think

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1588-1
00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:34.524
come and play when whenever it
is for me specifically to stick

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1588-2
00:12:34.524 --> 00:12:35.845
to my schedule.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1606-0
00:12:37.555 --> 00:12:41.188
Can you tell me about a time
when you had a particularly good

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1606-1
00:12:41.188 --> 00:12:44.705
night's sleep? What factors
contributed in that experience?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1611-0
00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:47.825
UMI.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1639-0
00:12:48.475 --> 00:12:52.226
It's it's a very recent
experience. A couple of days

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1639-1
00:12:52.226 --> 00:12:56.331
back, I did have a very good
night's sleep. It was almost

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1639-2
00:12:56.331 --> 00:12:58.525
around like 10 hours sleep and.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1641-0
00:12:58.965 --> 00:12:59.785
UM.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1669-0
00:13:00.755 --> 00:13:06.929
I I did everything possible to
keep myself relaxed right from

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1669-1
00:13:06.929 --> 00:13:13.103
like dimming the lights in the
room and taking a calming bath

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1669-2
00:13:13.103 --> 00:13:15.095
before going to bed.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1678-0
00:13:16.315 --> 00:13:19.475
And yeah, the next day when I
woke up, I was.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1687-0
00:13:20.165 --> 00:13:24.545
Extremely refreshed. I my energy
levels were.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1718-0
00:13:25.435 --> 00:13:30.990
Or at all time high and it did
make me feel very good. My mood

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1718-1
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.839
was completely fine. I didn't
feel sad or any sorts of

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1718-2
00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:38.485
negative emotions or thoughts.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1735-0
00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:44.372
Can you talk about like the
factors which contributed to

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1735-1
00:13:44.372 --> 00:13:46.905
that? I mean provide you that
experience?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1767-0
00:13:49.785 --> 00:13:55.297
I did tell you about the factors
like I I I purposely, I mean

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1767-1
00:13:55.297 --> 00:14:00.455
went for a shower before going
to bed and then I sort of.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1812-0
00:14:00.935 --> 00:14:06.429
Umm, just did things that were
making myself calm and my mind

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1812-1
00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:11.569
calm. I kept my phone away
before going to bed, or almost

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1812-2
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:16.887
like half an hour. I I I didn't
use my phone and I was just

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1812-3
00:14:16.887 --> 00:14:20.875
laying in bed till I eventually
fell asleep.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1826-0
00:14:22.805 --> 00:14:26.890
And yeah, I think getting away
from technology and like dimming

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1826-1
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.295
the lights and having.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1855-0
00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:35.880
As having like a quiet or. Yeah,
I did play some soothing music.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1855-1
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:42.126
It was like a rainfall in a
forest, kind of a a sound that I

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1855-2
00:14:42.126 --> 00:14:45.915
found on YouTube and that helped
me.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1860-0
00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:49.355
Fall asleep faster.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1873-0
00:14:50.595 --> 00:14:54.065
All right. Do you share your bed
with your partner or roommate?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1876-0
00:14:54.825 --> 00:14:55.655
Yes, I do.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1891-0
00:14:56.865 --> 00:15:00.415
How does their sleep schedule or
habits impact your own sleep?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1893-0
00:15:01.955 --> 00:15:02.735
Umm.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1922-0
00:15:03.845 --> 00:15:09.849
It does not really affect my
sleep inhabit that much, if if

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1922-1
00:15:09.849 --> 00:15:16.255
I'm if I'm feeling sleepy, I'll
just go to bed and that's that.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1935-0
00:15:19.275 --> 00:15:22.217
All right, so it is there
something that you wanna add on

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1935-1
00:15:22.217 --> 00:15:22.775
that thing?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1958-0
00:15:24.675 --> 00:15:27.778
Like, is that something like
you're concerned about? Your

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1940-0
00:15:25.115 --> 00:15:25.315
Uh.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1958-1
00:15:27.778 --> 00:15:31.042
partner's sleeping habit. That
might help, might impact your

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1958-2
00:15:31.042 --> 00:15:32.005
own sleep somehow.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1961-0
00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:35.445
Umm some?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/1970-0
00:15:35.525 --> 00:15:39.105
Times is just that, even if I am
feeling sleepy.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2020-0
00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:45.621
If I don't find my partner next
to me, I find it difficult to

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2020-1
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:50.439
fall asleep and then eventually
I will wake up and I'll I'll

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2020-2
00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:55.178
stay up and maybe we'll just
like binge watch something and

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2020-3
00:15:55.178 --> 00:15:59.838
things like that. So then it
sometimes this it does happen

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2020-4
00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:03.235
wherein his sleeping pattern
affects mine.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2022-0
00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:05.385
Right.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2046-0
00:16:06.045 --> 00:16:08.909
Are there any fact is or
information you think would be

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2046-1
00:16:08.909 --> 00:16:12.080
important for us to consider
when designing an app to promote

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2046-2
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.155
healthy sleep habits?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2048-0
00:16:15.005 --> 00:16:15.825
Umm.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2050-0
00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:19.695
I think.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2052-0
00:16:20.515 --> 00:16:21.085
Umm.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2056-0
00:16:21.785 --> 00:16:23.305
If the app is.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2070-0
00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:30.855
Ohm likes coming to look at or
it's like if if the app is.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2084-0
00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:37.025
Is like a place where you can
just slow down a little bit.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2086-0
00:16:37.585 --> 00:16:38.355
Umm.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2099-0
00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:44.045
I think that would really help
like to for for me to.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2102-0
00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:46.115
You know.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2128-0
00:16:47.645 --> 00:16:53.907
Experience good sleeping habits,
I think like using like soothing

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2128-1
00:16:53.907 --> 00:16:59.979
lighter colors or some sort of
interactive activity on the app.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2128-2
00:16:59.979 --> 00:17:03.395
I think that will be quite
helpful.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2147-0
00:17:05.005 --> 00:17:07.940
So you mean like put in some
activities like as you mentioned

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2147-1
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.355
previously like the painting
thing and everything?

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2152-0
00:17:10.265 --> 00:17:12.495
Yeah, yes, yes, yes.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2156-0
00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:14.505
That kind of things, alright.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2159-0
00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:15.765
Yes. Yeah.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2178-0
00:17:16.925 --> 00:17:20.173
So I think that's the end of it.
Do you have any questions or

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2178-1
00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:23.055

No, I think that's about it.

719ae36d-8a8b-4ab0-92cc-db7bac14bbb4/2212-0
