00:01:21.236 --> 00:01:21.940
weekdays?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/215-0
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.913
Yeah, actually on weekdays I go
to bed, I try to go to bed by 11

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/215-1
00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:36.100
or 12, but I find it very it's
like I find it very hard to fall

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/177-0
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.930
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/215-2
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.287
asleep, so it takes around one
or two hours of like to actually

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/215-3
00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:47.700
sleep. If I go to bed at 11, I
sleep at I maybe at one.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/243-0
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.721
So by then I just do some
scrolling or watch some stuff on

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/243-1
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:57.010

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.520
And by one, I fall asleep.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/263-0
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.470
And in the morning, I usually
wake up between 7:00 to 9:00 AM.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/274-0
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.370
And when I wake up, I'm like,
I'm feel a bit groggy.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/282-0
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.420
So I'm not at my best.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/277-0
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.620
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/290-0

Uh. more than I get up, so yeah.

weekends? Is it the same for the
weekends or it's like it's even

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/346-0
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.684
From being a weekend also is the
same thing because yeah, it's

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/323-2
00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.160
worse for the meetings?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/346-1
00:02:35.684 --> 00:02:39.733

well as weekends because I have

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/346-2
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:43.220

weekdays I'm attending

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/346-3
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.030
universities.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/355-0
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.290
Umm, alright.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.970
So it's like 7 days. The same
for me. Like, yeah.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/371-0
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.820
I'm always sleep deprived.
That's what I feel.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/369-0
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.230
And also.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/389-0
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.866
Like can you do you have an ID
of how much sleep are you

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/389-1
00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:57.430
getting in on an average?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/404-0
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.450
On an average, I get around six
to around 6 to 7 hours of sleep.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/408-0
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.210
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/426-0
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.967
But I think it's not, uh,
quality sleep which I'm looking

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/426-1
00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:11.990
for like I don't get any sound
sleep.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/439-0
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.540
And how do you usually wake up
in the morning? Do you feel

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/439-1
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.770
refreshed or tired?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/478-0
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.410
Uh, when I wake up, I don't feel
refreshed at all. I'm like,

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/478-1
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.265
usually tired and frustrated.
I'm like groggy. My mood mood is

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/478-2
00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:33.965
not good. So to deal with that,
I like guy, consume a lot of

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/478-3
00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:36.970
coffee and caffeine and energy
drinks.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/485-0
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.780
To get me through the day.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/504-0
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.386
And what are some factors that
impact your ability to fall

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/504-1
00:03:45.386 --> 00:03:46.910
asleep or stay asleep?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/520-0
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.581
I think the energy drinks and
caffeine consumption, it's

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/520-1
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:56.940

now.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/573-0

So I'm planning to quit the like
actually I've started like I've

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/573-1

lot of headaches and I'm feeling
a little. I'm feeling dizziness

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/573-4
00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:18.720
and fatigue.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/596-0
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.357
Throughout the day, but somehow
I'm managing it. I'm like taking

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/596-1

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.758
So are there any other factors
like noise? It can be noise.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/631-1

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/792-1
00:05:38.854 --> 00:05:43.383
deprivation. I'm having a like
very hard time concentrating on

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/792-2
00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:47.840
my projects and assignments and
my studies and like very hard

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/792-3
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.010
time like focusing and I'm
facing a lot of anxiety shoes.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/799-0
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.120
Lack of energy as well.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/815-0
00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.173
I feel a bit like all the time.
I'm tired since morning to the

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/815-1
00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:01.640
evening. I don't know.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/818-0
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.430
So yeah.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/826-0
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.990
The past two, three months have
been very difficult for me.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/828-0
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.000
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/835-0
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.880
I think it's all because of
sleep deprivation.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/850-0
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.883
Have you ever used an app or
other technology to improve your

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/850-1
00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:18.580
sleep habits?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/860-0
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.170
Actually.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/861-0
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.670
If so, what was your experience
like?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/871-0
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.900
Yeah, actually at the moment I'm
trying meditation.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/905-0
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.925
So I'm using the App Balance app
for meditation. They have a lot

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/905-1
00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:34.758
of different types of meditation
like wake up meditation and

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/905-2
00:06:34.758 --> 00:06:38.339
energize your more meditation.
So so they have different

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/905-3
00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:39.910
categories of meditation.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/913-0
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.940
So I'm using that at the moment
but.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/927-0
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.340
It's not helping me because,
like meditation doesn't give you

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/927-1
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.050
instant effect immediate
effects.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/943-0
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.229
So Yahoo, hopefully I'm waiting.
Like if I get results in the

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/943-1
00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:55.630
future.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/954-0
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.406
And do you have any specific
goals related to improving your

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/954-1
00:07:01.406 --> 00:07:02.160
sleep habits?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/964-0
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.580
Yeah. So to improve my sleep
habits, I'm taking melatonin.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1005-0
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.268
And I've stopped the caffeine
consumption like completely. I'm

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1005-1

haven't had any coffee or any
energy drink in any like, no

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1005-3
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:25.360
caffeine consumption in any
form.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1008-0
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.760
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1041-0

So yeah, it's been. It's my
second day today. But yeah, I'm

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1041-1

facing a little bit of headaches
and annotated like something

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1073-0
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.958
So do you wanna have so it's

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:35.720
about law.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1073-1
00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.241
wanna have like the constant
sleeping, should you you wanna

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1073-2
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:44.523
wake up like exact on the same
time having 8 hours of sleep

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1073-3
00:07:44.523 --> 00:07:48.024
every day. So that's like do you
have any goals related to that

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1073-4
00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:48.790
thing as well?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1090-0
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.041
Yeah, I actually, I don't know
how much optimal sleep I require

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1090-1
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:54.920
my body needs.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1095-0
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.250
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1152-0
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.287
So if I can have some app which
can track like how much optimal

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1152-1
00:07:59.287 --> 00:08:02.582
sleep is important for me?
Because it's like I think it's

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1152-2
00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:06.048
different for everyone, like
some some people are bored with

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1152-3
00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:09.627
like you know they can function
well on five hours sleep. Some

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1152-4
00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:13.037
people require 7 hours of sleep
to function well to be more

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1152-5
00:08:13.037 --> 00:08:14.400
productive the next day.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1183-0
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.727
So actually I don't know
optimally how much sleep is

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1183-1
00:08:18.727 --> 00:08:23.073
required for myself, but yeah,
if I can find some help through

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1183-2
00:08:23.073 --> 00:08:26.660

I'm very much open.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1203-0

To using it like which can track
my sleep and how good like the

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1203-1
00:08:32.547 --> 00:08:35.110
quality of my sleep my rent
cycle.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1210-0
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.030
So yeah, I'm open to it.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1234-0
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.534
So that's like what features
would you like to see in an app

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1234-1

designed to promote healthy
sleeping habits?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1268-0
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.879

So still during the next day, we
feel very lazy, so I need

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1305-1

In your career.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1549-0
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.167
And how do you currently use
technology in your daily life

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1549-1
00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:48.390
and how comfortable are you with
using new technology?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1581-0
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:55.179
Ohh, if it's like user friendly.
If the technology is user

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1581-1
00:10:55.179 --> 00:11:00.080
friendly and you know it's very
handy to use. So yeah I'm very

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1581-2
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.980
much comfortable using it but if
it's difficult then you know.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1586-0
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.490
Then I think.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1597-0
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.810
It depends on the user interface
and the features they provide.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1607-0
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.672
And also I need to see like you
know results like. I'm very

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1607-1
00:11:18.672 --> 00:11:19.450
impatient.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1614-0
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.870
So I need results like you know.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1620-0
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.300
Uh, little bit quicker results.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1622-0
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:27.950
OK.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1636-0
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:34.265
So do you often like do you set
multiple alarms for you when you

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1636-1
00:11:34.265 --> 00:11:34.890
wake up?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1647-0
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.190
Yeah, like I said, I put on two
or three alarms.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1654-0
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.960
Uh, in order to wake up in the
morning?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1669-0
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.780
So that's how I managed to.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1668-0
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.490
And is it easy?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1681-0
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.550
And is it easier for you to wake
up?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1679-0
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.900
It's very diff.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1694-0
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.598
It's really difficult for me to
wake up in the morning. It's

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1694-1
00:11:51.598 --> 00:11:52.150
very difficult.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1718-0
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.953
So we'll would you like an smart
alarm, which in which like wakes

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1718-1
00:11:56.953 --> 00:12:00.570
you in your lighter phase of the
time cycles rather than just on

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1718-2
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.460
the random time?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1724-0
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.450
Yeah, like that would be great.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1730-0
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.450
Something like that would be
great.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1752-0
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.410
And do you have any concerns
about using technology such as

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1752-1
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.556
machine learning, AI and
biometrics to improve your

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1752-2
00:12:14.556 --> 00:12:16.250
sleep? If so, what are they?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1769-0
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.870
If it's helping me, if it will
help me improve my sleep then

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1769-1
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.530
I'm very much open to it.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1776-0
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.160
I have all my support to it.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1795-0
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.774
So it like your concerns can be
like the data, it can be

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1795-1
00:12:30.774 --> 00:12:33.710
incorrect. So it you know that's
all.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1804-0
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.010
So do you have like concerns
regarding that that thing?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1815-0
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.930
Yeah, if the data is like, yeah,
The thing is.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1836-0
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.168
If it's ten to making errors, so
yeah, but like machine learning

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1836-1
00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:50.370
is like it learn from the error
like everything.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1840-0
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:51.620
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1863-0
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.861
Sorry, I'm very much open to it
because because right now I'm at

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1863-1
00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:58.250
this situation like, you know,
anything which improves my sleep

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1863-2
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.520
quality. I'm open to it.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1873-0
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.470
I'm that stage of at that stage
of my life at the moment.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1890-0
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.139
And how important is it to wake
up feeling refreshed and

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1890-1
00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:10.980
energized in the morning?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1903-0
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.662
The I think that's the most
important thing, because if you

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1903-1
00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:16.940
don't sleep properly.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1922-0
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.976
And you know, you wake up
feeling groggy and not energize,

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1922-1
00:13:21.976 --> 00:13:25.540
unmotivated. You feel like going
back to the bed.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1970-0
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.588
So if like it's very important
to take on the date like to be

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1928-0
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:27.830
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1970-1
00:13:30.588 --> 00:13:34.759
fresh to take on the day to take
on the daily task and it it, you

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1970-2
00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:38.740
know, it affects a lot of like
daily activities like you can't

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1970-3
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.900
focus on work, you can't focus
on your academics.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1976-0
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.870
Like put sleep is.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1979-0
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.350
Everything.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1982-0
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.170
Alright.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1998-0
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.549
What are some of the challenges
you face when it comes

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/1998-1
00:13:54.549 --> 00:13:56.700
maintaining healthy sleep
habits?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2013-0
00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:03.199
Ohh. One of the challenges I
face is like I don't have a

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2013-1
00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:04.520
proper sleeping.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2046-0
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.881
Schedule like I like. I don't
know. Like usually I don't have

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2046-1
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:14.843
a proper sleeping schedule. I go
to bed at anytime sometime. It's

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2046-2
00:14:14.843 --> 00:14:17.850
10 sometime it's 12 sometime
it's 1231.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2062-0
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:24.051
So I think I need to maintain a
proper timing like of sleeping

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2062-1
00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:25.220
and waking up.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2073-0
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.115
So I think that will help me
like so I need something which

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2073-1
00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:29.830
will you know.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2089-0
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.107
Uh, give me an alarm or give me
a notification. So like you

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2076-0
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.670
Mm-hmm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2089-1
00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:36.020
know, now it's the time to
sleep.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2119-0
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.147
Now is the time to wake up, and
now you have like, if you sleep

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2119-1
00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:45.656
now and you wake up now. So
these many hours of sleep will

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2111-0
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:44.620
So yeah.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2119-2
00:14:45.656 --> 00:14:47.500
give you like, you know proper.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2124-0
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.800
Uh, fully sound. Sleep.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2164-0
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.816
So like you will and won't it be
better if the application sends

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2164-1
00:14:55.816 --> 00:14:59.560
you a notification prior like
when's the right time to take

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2164-2
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.616
the last? Like last think of 13
or caffeine intake like whatever

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2164-3
00:15:03.616 --> 00:15:05.550
the preferences you are chosen.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2174-0
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.480
Actually, a caffeine has been
affecting my mental health.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2187-0
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:18.054
To a large extent, as I think
because you know I'm facing a

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2187-1
00:15:18.054 --> 00:15:19.340
lot of being.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2206-0
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:24.482
Like generalized anxiety, being
diagnosed with generalized

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2206-1
00:15:24.482 --> 00:15:26.800
anxiety disorder, which is GAD.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2220-0
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:33.785
So I think caffeine like you
know, it just amplifies my

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2220-1
00:15:33.785 --> 00:15:34.620
anxiety.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2277-0
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.477
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So
it's like, you know, for the

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2227-0
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:36.530
So.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2277-1
00:15:38.477 --> 00:15:41.134
people who are consuming
caffeine and are unable to

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2240-0
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:41.400
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2277-2
00:15:41.134 --> 00:15:44.352
sleep. So we can have the the
application implement, you know,

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2277-3
00:15:44.352 --> 00:15:47.723
saying like, it'll give them the
notification like 5 hours before

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2277-4
00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:50.993
or 4 hours before, like, that's
the last time they can have the

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2277-5
00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:53.240
nicotine for or the caffeine for
the night.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2352-0
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.312
I think even the five hours like
timing is too less like I think

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2352-1
00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:03.435
if they want to sleep at night,
like sound sleep, the last

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2352-2
00:16:03.435 --> 00:16:08.048
caffeine intake should be around
in the afternoon like 2:00 PM or

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2305-0
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.880
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2352-3
00:16:08.048 --> 00:16:12.240
3:00 PM. If they're sleeping at
10 or 11 because it's still

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2352-4
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.224
remains in the body and it
affects your sleep to a large

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2327-0
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.610
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2352-5
00:16:16.224 --> 00:16:20.417
extent. Like, you know, you
don't get a like quality sleep.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2352-6
00:16:20.417 --> 00:16:24.190
And it also depends on
individual to individual like.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2356-0
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.070
Different individuals.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2411-0
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.804
So how sensitive is their body
towards caffeine? Actually I I I

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2411-1
00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:36.919
I I know people who like drink
like four or five cups of coffee

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2411-2
00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:41.633
a day or like even on top of
that day. On top of that they

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2411-3
00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:46.588
even consume energy drinks but
still they have a good night's

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2411-4
00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:51.622
rest. But for me the problem is
like I'm I think I'm very much

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2411-5
00:16:51.622 --> 00:16:53.140
caffeine sensitive.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2420-0
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.980
So even two cups of coffee
affects me a lot.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2445-0
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.901
Can you tell me about the time
you had a particularly good

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2445-1
00:17:03.901 --> 00:17:06.919
night's sleep? What factors
contributed to to that

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2445-2
00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:07.570
experience?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2459-0
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:15.664
Yeah, like I remember like
couple of days back. I tried

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2459-1
00:17:15.664 --> 00:17:16.640
cannabis.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2461-0
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.090
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2469-0
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.510
In the form of.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2472-0
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.320
Do you mean like CBD oil, right?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2481-0
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.740
Not not the CBD oil, but.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2496-0
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.552
I don't know if it's any
appropriate to say on the

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2496-1
00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:32.480
interview or not. Like I smoked
up.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2499-0
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.540
It's not.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2511-0
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.020
So yeah, I smoked up and that
day.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2523-0
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:46.184
That day I had a very good night
rest. I woke up feeling

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2523-1
00:17:46.184 --> 00:17:47.000
refreshed.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2530-0
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.170
And and organize the next day.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2546-0
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.394
So yeah, after I I felt like
after so many years I had a good

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2546-1
00:17:55.394 --> 00:17:56.170
night rest.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2558-0
00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.657
And what can you tell like what
factors contributed in that

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2558-1
00:18:01.657 --> 00:18:02.410
experience?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2574-0
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.151
I just smoked up. I don't know
that I just smoked up and it it

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2574-1
00:18:10.151 --> 00:18:11.100
made me calm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2596-0
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.950
And there was no anxiety at all.
So I slept really well last

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2596-1
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.370
night and the next morning, I
woke up feeling refreshed.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2613-0
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.006
So yeah, that's what I'm saying.
So the factors can be you

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2604-0
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.970
And.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2613-1
00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:26.670
weren't anxious, you were like.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2630-0
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.157
Yeah, I was calm. I went and she
was. There was no work thinking

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2617-0
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.810
You know.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2630-1
00:18:31.157 --> 00:18:31.560
at all.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2633-0
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.070
So yeah.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2634-0
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.230
Used.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2643-0
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.700
Do you share a bed with your
partner or a roommate?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2648-0
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.550
No, I sleep on them.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2657-0
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.760
Because there's sleep shade like
alright.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2682-0
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.900
Are there any other factors or
information you think will be

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2682-1
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.447
important for us to consider
when designing an app to promote

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2682-2
00:18:56.447 --> 00:18:57.820
healthy sleeping habits?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2686-0
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.380
I think I like.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2728-0
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.410
For uh, if if it's a app, can
track if the person is anxious

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2728-1
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:12.058
on like the anxiety level or the
stress level, the cortisol

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2728-2
00:19:12.058 --> 00:19:15.950
levels, how much or basal levels
is that they're in their body?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2752-0
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.198
Which is affecting the speed
because you know stress and

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2752-1
00:19:21.198 --> 00:19:25.080
cortisol level anxiety. It also
affects the speed.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2773-0
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:31.106
So if the app can track that as
well, like how much a person is

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2773-1
00:19:31.106 --> 00:19:33.120
in the stress or anxious.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2778-0
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.390
So that would be of.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2780-0
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.720
Much help?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2787-0
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.890
Anything else that you like to
add?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2789-0
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.760
Umm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2800-0
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.440
At the moment, Doctor, because
these are the some of the issues

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2800-1
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:48.790
I face.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2802-0
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:50.910
Uh, yeah.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2809-0
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:52.910
I mentioned them all.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2808-0
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:52.870
And.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2816-0
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.790
How do you feel about the
alarms?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2825-0
00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.800
The traditional arms that we are
using.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2829-0
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.190
Are they helpful?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2845-0
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.622
They are like they they just
mean like they're just for

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2845-1
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:07.360
waking you up.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2859-0
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.007
So I don't know because I
haven't used any smart alarm as

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2859-1
00:20:12.007 --> 00:20:13.330
of now to be honest.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2880-0
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.283
So I don't know how much good or
better they are, like how much

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2880-1
00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:21.300
they have been promised on the
traditional alarm.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2901-0
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.183
And as you mentioned, like you
said multiple alarms, so do you

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2901-1
00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:29.380
often hit the snooze button when
the alarm is present?

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2904-0
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.930
Hmm yeah.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2922-0
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.460
I lived there like I did it. I
do it every time.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2912-0
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.070

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2943-0
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.166
So it's like you snooze and you
go back to sleep and then alarm

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2943-1

Yeah.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2959-0
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.239
Yeah, yeah, it buzzes again.
Then again, I wake up and I

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2959-1
00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:46.520

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2967-0
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.350
And then 3/4 times like I wake
up.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2973-0
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.890
After 3-4 alarms.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2972-0
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.590
And.

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2986-0

977b7260-6c3b-4f93-97bb-6507a862f5ce/2986-1
