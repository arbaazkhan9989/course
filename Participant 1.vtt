00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.480
Let's begin.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/19-0
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.721
Can you tell me about your
typical sleep schedule on

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/19-1
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.280
weekdays?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/51-0
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.835
Umm, I usually sleep for 8 hours
or at least I tried to sleep for

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/51-1
00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.822
8 hours during the week days
because I have most of the days

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/51-2
00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.130
I have lectures.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/69-0
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.652
UM, but sometimes I can't sleep
for 8 hours. It depends on so

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/69-1
00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:31.800
many factors.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/82-0
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.208
And can you talk about like is
it is it the same for the

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/82-1
00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:35.960
weekends as well?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/101-0
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.959
No, for the weekends it's
completely different. I usually

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/101-1
00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:43.300
tend to oversleep on the
weekends.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/115-0
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.840
Is that I have nothing to do.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/113-0
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.470
So do you.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/129-0
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.940
So do you have an average like
the duration for your sleep?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/133-0
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.990
In the weekend.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/135-0
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.560
Yeah.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/137-0
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.850
Uh.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/146-0
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.780
From 10 hours to 12 hours, it
depends.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/153-0
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.930
But in that list.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/154-0
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.990
And on weekdays.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/161-0
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.530
Week Days 8 hours or.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/163-0
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.820
Less.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/177-0
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.018
How do you usually feel when you
wake up in the morning? Do you

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/177-1
00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:13.240
feel refreshed or tired?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/190-0
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.220
I feel refreshed if I get enough
sleep, but mostly tired.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/194-0
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.100
Umm and like?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/206-0
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.070
Do you have like this specific
things like what's the reason

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/206-1
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.680
behind that?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/208-0
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.780
Ohh.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/234-0
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.695
Mostly because I didn't sleep
enough. That's why I wake up

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/219-0
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.010
Right.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/234-1
00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:38.887
feeling tired, or the opposite,
which is oversleeping, which

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/234-2
00:01:38.887 --> 00:01:39.850
also makes me.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/237-0
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.000
Died.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/251-0
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.374
What are some of the factors
that impact your ability to fall

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/251-1
00:01:46.374 --> 00:01:47.020
asleep or?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/266-0
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.202
And the factors that impact my
ability to fall asleep, it's

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/266-1
00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:57.650
basically my.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/269-0
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.500
Stress.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/280-0
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.530
That's one of the biggest
reasons less anxiety.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/273-0
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.900
Hmm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/292-0
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.040
Uh, if I consumed a lot of
caffeine or nicotine?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/297-0
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.940
And if I'm surrounded in a.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/317-0
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.905
Around people who are making a
lot of noises, you know, another

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/317-1
00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.080
quiet environment for me to fall
asleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/322-0
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.460
Yeah, that would be.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/324-0
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.240
That'll be it.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/340-0
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.930
Can you talk about some factors
that impact your ability to stay

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/340-1
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.410
asleep?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/344-0
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.830
Stay asleep is.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/352-0
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.390
Yeah. See environment amenable
atmosphere.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/359-0
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.430
With it, if it's a quiet place.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/361-0
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.840
Light.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/363-0
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.120
Uh.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/376-0
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.840
Anxiety sometimes affect that,
but mostly.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/386-0
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.860
Mostly, if I fell asleep, I'll
be just OK.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/398-0
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.930
I'm just having a problem zoned
for.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/396-0
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.430
And do the fact.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/413-0
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.836
And to the factors like noise
and everything just counts in as

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/413-1
00:02:57.836 --> 00:02:58.130
well.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/417-0
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.350
Yes, yes.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/444-0
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.739
What are some of the fact like.
Yeah, yeah, that's done. Have

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/444-1
00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.055
you ever experienced any
negative effects of lack of

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/444-2
00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:14.184
sleep such as difficulty
concentrating or feeling

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/444-3
00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:14.810
irritable?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/478-0
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.177
Whenever I have like lack of
sleep, it's either I am tired

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/478-1
00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:24.561
most of the day, easily
distracted, and yeah, I just

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/478-2
00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:28.520
like it's mentioned here. I find
it difficult to concentrate.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/488-0
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.210
But mostly it's feeling tired
and easily distracted.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/498-0
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.380
And is it hard for you to
concentrate like I mean?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/505-0
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.640
Yeah, of course.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/504-0
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.590
For the day.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/507-0
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.710
Yes.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/542-0
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.319
Have you ever used an app or
other technology to help improve

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/542-1
00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.290
your sleep habits? If so, what
was your experience like?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/570-0
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.280
No, actually I have never tried
anything. Sometimes I already.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/555-0
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.360
Alright.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/570-1
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.157
I've already verified factors
but I don't do anything about

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/570-2
00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:02.480
them.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/583-0
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.934
So like, is there any method
like how you make yourself fall

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/583-1
00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:07.860
asleep or something?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/622-0
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.253
Uh, yeah, I tried to imagine
stuff in my head, you know, try

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/622-1
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.010
to calm myself down, because
when I not when I'm unable to

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/622-2
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.893
fall asleep, I get irritated
because I wasn't. I wasn't able

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/622-3
00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.740
to fall asleep and then just.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/641-0
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.706
I keep thinking about it, so I
I'm just trying. I try to

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/641-1
00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:31.160
imagine stuff you know, and calm
myself down so I can fall

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/641-2
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.570
asleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/661-0
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.047
And what's your experience with
that thing? Like is it? Does

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/661-1
00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:39.830
that help you and is it
effectively coming?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/660-0
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.390
It's.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/668-0
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.360
It does, actually. Yeah. It
helps a lot.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/676-0
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.620
But sometimes it doesn't work.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/679-0
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.950
Alright, alright.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/690-0
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.976
Do you have any specific goals
related to improving your sleep

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/690-1
00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:51.340
habits?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/695-0
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.000
Do I have?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/706-0
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.360
Goals related to improving my
sleep habits.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/703-0
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.420
Specific.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/708-0
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.700
Yeah.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/711-0
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.320
Ah.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/721-0
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.240
I mean, the main goal is just to
have a good sleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/741-0
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.948
But I don't. I don't do anything
about it. Honestly. Like I don't

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/741-1
00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:16.660
have. I don't have plans to
reach that goal.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/758-0
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.758
Hmm. Busted. I mean, just we are
talking about the goal that you

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/758-1
00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:22.030
have.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/784-0
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.873
The goal is to have enough sleep
and be basically able to fall

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/784-1
00:05:29.873 --> 00:05:34.700
asleep once I I want to not to
try to sleep for 2-3 hours.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/801-0
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.222
And you wanna add like pink
consistent in this in your sleep

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/790-0
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.880
Well.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/801-1
00:05:40.222 --> 00:05:41.980
cycle through this point as
well.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/803-0
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.260
Sorry.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/826-0
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.803
Yeah, I mean, do you wanna add
like being consistent in yours?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/810-0
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.550
And I.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/826-1
00:05:48.803 --> 00:05:51.020
Like sleeping habits on this
point as well?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/835-0
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.020
Oh, no, no, I am not, I think.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/859-0
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.844
The fact that I oversleep in the
weekends and it doesn't really

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/859-1
00:06:00.844 --> 00:06:04.500
help me having a a consistent
sleeping schedule.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/882-0
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.009
So it's either I sleep a lot or
I don't sleep enough. It has

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/866-0
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.430
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/882-1
00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.500
always been that way.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/896-0
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.433
What features would you like to
see in an app design to promote

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/896-1
00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:18.790
healthy sleep and habits?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/899-0
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.160
And.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/917-0
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.591
I want to have the notification
to tell me what to do and what

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/917-1
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:28.630
not to do like.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/952-0
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.108
Yeah, I know that one of the
factors is the large consumption

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/952-1
00:06:33.108 --> 00:06:37.293
of caffeine. So it'd be it would
be very helpful to have a

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/952-2
00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:41.904
notification telling you when to
stop drinking caffeine on, when

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/952-3
00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:45.380
to stop smoking or what to eat,
what not to eat.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/957-0
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.550
You know, this kind of stuff.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/959-0
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.650
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/973-0
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.730
How do you currently wake up? Is
it all through alarms?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/966-0
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.900
And that's it.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/975-0
00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.570
Yes.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/982-0
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.400
And and do you think they are
effective?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/984-0
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.180
Uh.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1007-0
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.179
It's kinda annoying. Yeah.
Whenever I wake up to the other

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/993-0
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.930
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1007-1
00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:14.750
it just it makes my mood really,
really bad. And I tend to just.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1020-0
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.890
Shut it down and go back to
sleep. But I I always try to.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1045-0
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.644
Fight that urge of going back to
sleep because of the bad way. I

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1045-1
00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:27.950
woke up with, which is a very
bad sound of an alarm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1060-0
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.380
And like, do you set multiple
alarms? Why when you wake up?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1064-0
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.550
No, no.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1086-0
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.152
This is the only good thing I
do. I I can wake up from one

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1086-1
00:07:41.152 --> 00:07:44.590
alarm. I try to push myself to
wake up from 1:00 alarm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1088-0
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.440
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1105-0
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.879
So like it works for you, right?
That's what you mean? Like said

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1105-1
00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:52.770
in single alarm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1103-0
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.480
Yeah, it.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1121-0
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.228
The single line is is enough for
me. Yeah. Yeah. I don't need

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1121-1
00:07:57.228 --> 00:07:57.830
multiples.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1137-0
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.966
And linked, what do you do it
like when you wake up? So do you

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1137-1
00:08:02.966 --> 00:08:05.310
stay in bed or do you just move
out of the bed?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1140-0
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.550
Uhm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1147-0
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.290
Mostly I just stay in bed.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1160-0
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.600
You know, screaming in my phone,
using my phone for like, an hour

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1160-1
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.060
at least.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1173-0
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.110
And then this makes me wanna go
back to sleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1165-0
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.570
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1181-0
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.020
And makes me even more tired
than I woke up.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1209-0
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.519
Uh, but I try to stop doing
that. But if I am, if I have a

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1209-1
00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:33.312
weekend, if I'm in a weekend, I
just stay in bed for like a

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1209-2
00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:36.600
couple of hours like little,
little to three hours.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1215-0
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.190
How important is it?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1226-0
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.120
To you, to wake up feeling

morning.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1251-0
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.616
It's critically important. I
mean, if you don't start your

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1251-1
00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:53.295

00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:53.830
bad day.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1253-0

It it it might affect your
efficiency. That's why you're

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1295-1

trying to say.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1314-0

physical state as well.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1337-0

bed. So it's both the mental
state of the physical state.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1339-0
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:31.600
Right.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.229
Do you have any concerns using
technology such as machine

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1360-1
00:09:36.229 --> 00:09:40.227

No, actually I don't have anyone

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1377-0
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.460
As long as they cannot help me.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1392-0
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.570
Maintain or have a consistent
sleeping habit.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1385-0
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.710
So.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1416-0
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.719
I mean, you. Can I, isha like
you can rely on these things for

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1416-1
00:09:57.719 --> 00:09:59.720
your like, improving your sleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1418-0
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.440
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1426-0
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.520
Hopefully, like yeah, I believe
I can rely on them.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1472-0
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.466
Yeah, you're concerns can
include, like, uh, inappropriate

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1472-1
00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:13.823
data collection. So, you know,
if the by like biometric

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1472-2
00:10:13.823 --> 00:10:17.239
sensors, they are, are they on
to be able to pick up the

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1472-3
00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:20.656
information like properly. So
they might provide you the

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1472-4
00:10:20.656 --> 00:10:23.953
information incorrectly. So
that's like there can be a

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1472-5
00:10:23.953 --> 00:10:26.830
concern like that thing what I'm
trying to say.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1474-0
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.470
Uh.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1479-0
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.810
Umm can you say that again?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1515-0
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.575
For example, if your biometrics
like the when you are tracking

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1515-1
00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:42.280
your sleep, it might collect
your data in accurately and

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1500-0
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:40.900
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1515-2
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.790
which might result in showing
the inappropriate data.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1544-0
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.069
So that can be one of your
concern. So like there that's

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1522-0
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.040
Ohh.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1544-1
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:53.321
what I'm trying to say. So don't
you think like it can be a

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1544-2
00:10:53.321 --> 00:10:54.460
concern or something?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1564-0
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.768
It can be a concern, but I don't
think it happens majorly. It

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1564-1
00:10:59.768 --> 00:11:00.950
could be minorly.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1569-0
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:02.440
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1584-0
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.207
So I I believe too, I think we
should trust that it made a new

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1584-1
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.470
works out correctly.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1595-0
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.200
So I don't think it's a major
concern.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1590-0
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.490
All right.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1612-0
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.747
What are some of the challenges
you face when it comes to

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1612-1
00:11:16.747 --> 00:11:18.750
maintaining healthy sleep
habits?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1623-0
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.720
I wasn't able to stop smoking
before going to bed.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1649-0
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:34.131
And I couldn't also stop the
stress that I believe it's one

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1649-1
00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:38.900
of the reasons why I I problems
falling asleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1664-0
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:45.489
UM and in the other hand, once I
fell asleep, I didn't to

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1664-1
00:11:45.489 --> 00:11:46.500
oversleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1671-0
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.730
And I couldn't stop doing that
like.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1673-0
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:50.830
It's.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1686-0
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.080
I always tend to oversleep, and
the day that I couldn't sleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1709-0
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.030
So it affects me badly. Like I
fell asleep finally after like

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1709-1
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.898
2-3 hours and then I turned to
oversleep, which messes up with

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1709-2
00:12:06.898 --> 00:12:07.130
my.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1727-0
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.897
Sleeping schedule for the next
day, so I sleep even more later

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1727-1
00:12:12.897 --> 00:12:14.690
the next day, and so on.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1731-0
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.720
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1739-0
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.290
And this this really effects my
my bedtime schedule.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1741-0
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.490
Right.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1764-0
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.478
Can you tell me about a time
when you had a particularly good

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1764-1
00:12:28.478 --> 00:12:32.540
night's sleep? What factors
contributed to the experience?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1774-0
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.490
I would say when I stopped
smoking.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1779-0
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.930
I used to have a very good
sleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1783-0
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.400
And.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1787-0
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.250
Also when I.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1801-0
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.793
I you don't, you don't want me
to like define A1 single day,

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1801-1
00:12:52.793 --> 00:12:53.820
right? It's just.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1809-0
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.360
I can talk about multiple times,
right?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1823-0
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.150
Yeah, it can be anything like
anything. That's fine for you.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1838-0
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.131
Uh, OK, uh, another another
time. When I had a very good

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1838-1
00:13:05.131 --> 00:13:07.570
sleep was when I finished my
exam.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1855-0
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.009
Like the next few days after
that I had really good sleep

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1843-0
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.020
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1855-1
00:13:12.009 --> 00:13:12.760
like I just.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1862-0
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.590
Thought about sleeping and I
directly fell asleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1881-0
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.360
Alright, so anxiety can be a
factor as well. Anxiety and

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1881-1
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.600
stress in like getting on.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1880-0
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.920
100% yes.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1892-0
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.120
Do you share your bed with a
partner or a roommate?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1897-0
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:35.860
Sometimes yes.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1909-0
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.480
How does their sleep schedule or
habits impact your own sleep?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1924-0
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.630
Not negatively. I think it's
mostly positively. It actually

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1924-1
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.740
helps me fall asleep easier.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1926-0
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.460
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1942-0
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.626
And it doesn't affect. It
doesn't affect my sleep habits

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1942-1
00:13:56.626 --> 00:13:59.270
negatively. It's mostly
positively.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1953-0
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.640
Does that answer your question?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1954-0
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.040
Are there any other factor?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1960-0
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.290
Well, it's like, yeah.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1984-0
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.480
Are there any other factors or
information you think would be

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1984-1
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.019
important for us to consider
when designing an app to promote

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1984-2
00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:16.390
healthy sleeping habits?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1986-0
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.810
Uh.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1993-0
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.870
Actors all information.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2010-0
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.510
Yeah, that you think would be
important for us to consider

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/1999-0
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.770
14.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2010-1
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.890
when designing an app.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2022-0
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:38.520
Uh, I'm not sure if you if this
could be like a personalized.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2027-0
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.250
At right?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2059-0
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.871
You just say what's like what's
it can be anything. It can be

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2046-0
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.750
Is it going to be a personalized
like?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2059-1
00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:47.910
like anything that's on your
mind.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2056-0
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.900
I it.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2064-0
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.570
And well, I think it's.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2081-0
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.501
It would be much better if the
app could like I can put

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2081-1
00:14:56.501 --> 00:14:58.330
information the app.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2087-0
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.800
UM like?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2086-0
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.210
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2105-0
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:07.141
And recording my data by myself
which can like yeah can use this

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2105-1
00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:08.680
data to help me.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2147-0
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.677
Regulate my sleep somehow, like
I want it to be a personalized

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2147-1
00:15:14.677 --> 00:15:19.515
ohh a rather than just something
general for everyone, because

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2147-2
00:15:19.515 --> 00:15:24.122
the if it's that the case then
we can just have information

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2147-3
00:15:24.122 --> 00:15:24.660
online.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2167-0
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.740
So it's like you want the
application to provide the

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2167-1
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.870
information which is good for
you rather than in general.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2186-0
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.020
Yes, exactly. According to the
records that the app have

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2186-1
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.733
already collected, either
through me or through the

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2186-2
00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:42.590
parametrics.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2222-0
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.153
Yeah. So yeah, I think that's
the thing that we'll be working

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2222-1
00:15:48.153 --> 00:15:51.753
on on cause we'll be in
implementing AI, ML and other

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2222-2
00:15:51.753 --> 00:15:55.953
things, you know, just to make
like application, which is like

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2222-3
00:15:55.953 --> 00:15:58.220
personalized for a person
itself.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2227-0
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.040
That sounds very cool.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2256-0
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.018
And also like like can do you
have like specific things that

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2256-1
00:16:07.018 --> 00:16:11.235
you wanna talk about like when
waking up like how can we make

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2256-2
00:16:11.235 --> 00:16:13.820
it easier for people to wake
them up?

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2260-0
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.170
UM.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2265-0
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.670
Easier to wake them up.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2279-0
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.363
Basis played to wake me up is
when I know that I had enough

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2279-1
00:16:27.363 --> 00:16:27.700
sleep.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2283-0
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:29.520
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2352-0
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.790
I mean, just like I told you, I
always have this problem. It's

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2352-1
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.219
either I don't sleep enough or I
oversleep and both both cases

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2352-2
00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:42.649
and makes me feel sick or tired.
Sorry. So I just. It would be

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2352-3
00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:47.079
good if, like, for example, in
weekends I just sit there and I

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2352-4
00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:51.439
sit on the app that I am going
to sleep right now and it will

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2352-5
00:16:51.439 --> 00:16:53.900
automatically set an alarm for
me.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2355-0
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:55.590
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2371-0
00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.690
To wake me up at any certain
time where at that time I will

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2371-1
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.720
have enough.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2381-0
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.570
Sleep and I wake up feeling
good, not tired.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2392-0
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.871
That's why that's exactly what I
meant by personalized

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2392-1
00:17:09.871 --> 00:17:10.600
experience.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2391-0
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:10.560
Umm.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2394-0
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.160
OK.

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2416-0
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.404
So I think that's all we we are
good to go. Do you have any

ec1f6e23-5dd7-4440-9e17-a9aa430422bb/2416-1

No, I think I'm good.
