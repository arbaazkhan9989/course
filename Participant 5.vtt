00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:23.441

felt I felt that lack of energy

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/195-2
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:27.888

of coffee, I feel I felt like

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/195-3
00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.512
that. Now I'm able to do
something.

00:01:31.982 --> 00:01:32.272
Hmm.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/226-0
00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:36.619

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/226-1
00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.005
years that when after waking up
I felt that I'm not having any

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/226-2
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:41.492
energy.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/240-0
00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:47.435

factors that impact your ability

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/240-1
00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:48.452
to fall asleep?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/260-0
00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:55.407
I'm not able to focus upon
present, I I always overthink

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/260-1
00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:57.052
about future or past.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/273-0
00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:01.662

difficulties in sleeping I.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/278-0
00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.762
I overthink a lot.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/298-0
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:09.070
So it's a stress anxiety and
like you can add on like

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/298-1
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.892

And.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/313-0

I think.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/326-0
00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:22.388
It mostly over thinking about
the things which is not going to

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/326-1
00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:22.982
happen to me.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/355-0

you the there's some
distraction, it can be your

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/355-3
00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:34.702
phone.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/418-0
00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:40.324
Just there is a huge distraction
in my life, like my mobile

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/418-1
00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:44.492

whenever my friend friends came,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.987

building. They knocked my window

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/418-4
00:02:53.987 --> 00:02:58.619
and they want to talk to me.
They didn't care about whether

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/418-5
00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.560
I'm sleeping or not. So this is
like, this is the most thorough

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/418-6
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.802
destruction in my life. Mobile
phone and.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/423-0

Someone knocking about my
window.

sleep such as difficulty
concentrating or fearing feeling

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/449-2
00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:22.652
irritable?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/461-0
00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:29.552

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/477-1
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.782
small things.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/490-0
00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:43.958

something because I'm not having

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/483-0
00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:41.832

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:44.742
enough sleep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/533-0
00:03:45.962 --> 00:03:49.596
All right, you're right. So it's
like you when you feel like you

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/533-1
00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.615
are, you didn't have enough
sleep. So it's like is it

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/533-2
00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:55.578
difficult for you for like
focusing on like for your

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/533-3
00:03:55.578 --> 00:03:58.709
lectures or the work that you
are doing, it can be like

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/533-4
00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.212
anything.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/573-0
00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:03.952
Just big. It's a chain of
sequence where whenever I'm not

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/573-1
00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:08.152
having sleep, I'm not. I'm not
having energy, so I'm not able

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/573-2
00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:12.285
to focus upon things I usually
restricted while while in the

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/573-3
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:16.012
lecture or or I zoned out in
between the conversation.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/597-0
00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:22.049
So you prefer like you say you
are trying to say like it

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/597-1
00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.421
reduces your efficiency
directly, right? If there is

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/590-0
00:04:23.872 --> 00:04:24.292
Yep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/597-2
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:26.312
lack of sleep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/599-0
00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:27.352
Yeah.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/619-0
00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:32.616
Have you ever used an app or
technology to help improve your

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/619-1
00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:35.952

00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:42.005
I didn't use any kind of
technology, but I used to wear

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/639-1
00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:43.182

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:47.569
Ohh, I used to measure how much
I sleep and how much I deep

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/652-1
00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:47.922

I didn't use any kind of any

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/663-0
00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:52.342

00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:56.092
particular application for
sleeping.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/703-0
00:05:03.932 --> 00:05:08.942
I checked that I I'm getting
deep sleep for one or 1 1/2

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/703-1
00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:12.282
hours and normal sleep for 4-5
hours.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/714-0

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:39.767
After doing meditation, I feel
like it is easy to sleep after

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/769-1
00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:44.532

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.610
imagine in some random stories.
Imagine in some cartoons or

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/810-3
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.572
something like that. Do you have
any specific method?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/817-0

All right.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/829-0
00:06:09.442 --> 00:06:12.808
Do you have any specific goals
related to improving your sleep

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/829-1
00:06:12.808 --> 00:06:13.182
habits?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/861-0

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:25.298
will. I will get tired and
eventually I will get sleep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/861-2
00:06:25.298 --> 00:06:29.712
This is my I'm thinking about to
do this technique.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/873-0

To get tired, then get sleep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/882-0
00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:37.412
And anything that you will like
to add on this thing.

Eat proper thing and drink.
Drink lots of water. This is the

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/896-1
00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:48.012

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:53.933
To get a good sleep and
currently I'm using chamomile

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/931-1
00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:58.349
tea to get a sleep, but I think
it is not working for more

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/931-2
00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:01.942
working for me and I'm using
lavender oil also.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/946-0
00:07:05.902 --> 00:07:08.955
What features would you like to
see in an app designed to

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/946-1
00:07:08.955 --> 00:07:10.482

how to improve your sleep cycle

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/975-1
00:07:24.322 --> 00:07:27.592

do not to do and.

because sometime I felt that

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1014-3
00:07:43.744 --> 00:07:47.852
after drinking alcohol I'm not
able to sleep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1022-0
00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.892
So this is my personal
experience that.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1019-0

00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:04.808
you want to do in your whole. If
you're not feeling fresh then it

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1482-3
00:11:04.808 --> 00:11:08.488
will be difficult for you to
concentrate on things and do

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1482-4
00:11:08.488 --> 00:11:09.122
your work.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1491-0
00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:13.542
So it's like being more
productive throughout the day.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1493-0
00:11:14.212 --> 00:11:14.652
Yep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1519-0
00:11:15.652 --> 00:11:18.650
And two, when I have something
like, you can be better at work

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1519-1
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.506
or your lecture. Like how will
you feel like if you wake up

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1519-2
00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:23.362
refreshed or energized in the
morning?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1554-0
00:11:25.172 --> 00:11:30.080
If I've, if I wake up energized,
then I'm able to focus more on

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1554-1
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.912
lecture and I will. I will be
more energized and I can do more

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1554-2
00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:36.062
physical works.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1583-0
00:11:39.302 --> 00:11:42.566
Alright. Do you have any
concerns about using technology

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1583-1
00:11:42.566 --> 00:11:45.601
such as machine learning,
artificial intelligence or

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1583-2
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:48.866
biometric sensors to improve
your sleep? If so, what are

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1583-3
00:11:48.866 --> 00:11:49.152
they?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1608-0
00:11:56.152 --> 00:12:00.321
Not having any concern, but I
think it will be very helpful if

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1608-1
00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:04.688
we use machine learning and deep
learning technologies to improve

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1608-2
00:12:04.688 --> 00:12:05.482
sleep cycle.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1610-0
00:12:07.572 --> 00:12:07.892
Umm.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1648-0
00:12:09.242 --> 00:12:12.830
So your concerns can include
like maybe on the let's imagine

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1648-1
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.301
a scenario where you were
wearing Apple Watch or something

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1648-2
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:19.948
which which was collecting your
sleep data and eventually the

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1648-3
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:23.772
data was wrong. So it might show
you like the wrong information.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1669-0
00:12:24.482 --> 00:12:26.992
How about your sleep patterns
and it can suggest you something

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1669-1
00:12:26.992 --> 00:12:29.382
to that can be your concern.
That's what I'm trying to say.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1669-2
00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:31.852
Hey, do you have any concerns
about regarding the technology?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1680-0
00:12:34.242 --> 00:12:39.812
No, but sometimes only sometimes
it will predict the wrong data.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1687-0
00:12:42.732 --> 00:12:44.652
So you can rely on technology,
right?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1690-0
00:12:45.002 --> 00:12:45.812
Yeah, yeah.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1705-0
00:12:47.712 --> 00:12:50.801
What are some of the challenges
you face when it comes to

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1705-1
00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:52.612
maintaining healthy sleep
habits?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1715-0
00:12:56.952 --> 00:12:59.052
Uh, sometime I was able to
sleep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1744-0
00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:04.389
Well, one or two weeks, great
sleep. But after after some time

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1744-1
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:09.645
that someone, someone will come
to my room and they they start

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1744-2
00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:12.232
talking and someone play music.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1757-0
00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:18.494
This will this will make problem
for me for me to sleep that

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1757-1
00:13:18.494 --> 00:13:18.902
time.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1778-0
00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:25.070
So it can. It's like social
pressure and like the social

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1778-1
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.592
pressure that's contributing in
that thing.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1770-0
00:13:25.102 --> 00:13:25.342
Yep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1785-0
00:13:27.912 --> 00:13:29.942
Yeah, yeah, social pressure.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1796-0
00:13:30.052 --> 00:13:34.231
And so it's like anything else,
like you like to add on that

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1796-1
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:34.642
thing?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1803-0
00:13:36.602 --> 00:13:40.722
And sometimes social pressure
and uh.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1813-0
00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:45.932
Sometimes works. It depends upon
the upon the time to time.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1821-0
00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:49.272
Yeah, it can be assignments like
at times, right?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1824-0
00:13:49.782 --> 00:13:50.492
Yep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1844-0
00:13:51.182 --> 00:13:54.441
So it can be accurate you say,
like, let's conclude that thing.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1844-1
00:13:54.441 --> 00:13:57.242
So it's academic pressure for
you and social pressure.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1847-0
00:13:57.952 --> 00:13:58.342
Yep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1850-0
00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:00.232
Alright.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1870-0
00:14:01.292 --> 00:14:05.585
Can we? Can you tell me about a
time you had a particularly good

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1870-1
00:14:05.585 --> 00:14:09.482
night's sleep? What factors
contributed to the experience?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1875-0
00:14:11.382 --> 00:14:12.642
Good time sleep.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1877-0
00:14:13.302 --> 00:14:13.742
Umm.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1901-0
00:14:15.842 --> 00:14:21.487
When I when I used to go to gym,
I I work out for one or two

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1901-1
00:14:21.487 --> 00:14:26.392
hours. After that I will get a
good sleep that time.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1913-0
00:14:28.092 --> 00:14:31.398
And like what factors
contributed to that experience?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1913-1
00:14:31.398 --> 00:14:32.622
Can you define them?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1957-0
00:14:33.862 --> 00:14:38.496
What factors? That time I was
doing a proper diet and I I am

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1957-1
00:14:38.496 --> 00:14:43.359
drinking water and that time I
was not having that much anxiety

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1957-2
00:14:43.359 --> 00:14:47.537
and after doing work out
eventually you get tired then

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1957-3
00:14:47.537 --> 00:14:51.412
you can get a good sleep. This
is what I observed.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1977-0
00:14:52.702 --> 00:14:56.244
And do you have the specific
reason why when people are you

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1977-1
00:14:56.244 --> 00:14:58.252
want that anxious at that
moment?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/1993-0
00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:06.512
Joe, I knows few of the reasons
that I'm why I'm anxious.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2002-0
00:15:07.912 --> 00:15:10.752
Are you just? Can you explain it
a bit more?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2004-0
00:15:13.522 --> 00:15:14.042
Yeah.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2059-0
00:15:14.852 --> 00:15:19.802
Previously I was having one
girlfriend, so we break up and

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2059-1
00:15:19.802 --> 00:15:25.255
now the things is not getting on
what I what I was imagining. So

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2059-2
00:15:25.255 --> 00:15:30.456
I was I was thinking about that
thing and the second thing is

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2029-0
00:15:26.772 --> 00:15:27.172
Umm.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2059-3
00:15:30.456 --> 00:15:35.825
I'm thinking I'm thinking about
to learn a few things and I was

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2059-4
00:15:35.825 --> 00:15:39.852
not able to give that time to
learn that thing.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2067-0
00:15:40.532 --> 00:15:44.942
And and and thinking about the
future.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2069-0
00:15:46.582 --> 00:15:46.972
Alright.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2071-0
00:15:47.842 --> 00:15:48.472
So.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2087-0
00:15:49.872 --> 00:15:53.331
And and like you said, like, do
you know the factors? Is there

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2087-1
00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:55.582
anything else that you wanna
talk about?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2097-0
00:15:57.252 --> 00:16:01.430
Ah, no, I think this is this is
the most affecting factor for

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2097-1
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.632
me.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2110-0
00:16:02.652 --> 00:16:05.724
So it's it's stressing you about
like your life and everything,

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2110-1
00:16:05.724 --> 00:16:06.012
right?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2112-0
00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:06.952
Yeah.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2122-0
00:16:10.232 --> 00:16:12.792
Do you share your bed with a
partner or a roommate?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2132-0
00:16:16.072 --> 00:16:18.432
Nowadays I'm not sharing my bed
with anyone.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2141-0
00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:21.992
Yeah. So let's assume when you
were.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2163-0
00:16:23.362 --> 00:16:27.022
So when you were sharing your
partner bed with a roommate or a

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2163-1
00:16:27.022 --> 00:16:30.623
partner, how did their sleep
schedule or habits impacted your

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2163-2
00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:30.972
sleep?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2206-0
00:16:32.872 --> 00:16:37.890
If someone is snoring me then
I'm not able to sleep and I am a

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2206-1
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.669
guy who's sleep in the at the
king size bed in the single I

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2206-2
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:46.492
used to sleep at the king size
king size alone.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2201-0
00:16:43.912 --> 00:16:44.572
Yeah.

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2229-0
00:16:47.422 --> 00:16:51.302
So if someone is sleeping beside
me and they are taking space,

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2229-1
00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:54.812
then it will be little bit
difficulty for getting little

00:16:54.812 --> 00:16:56.352
bit difficulty from this.

00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:04.162
And do you think they're habits
like specific habits can affect

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2249-1
00:17:04.162 --> 00:17:05.162
your sleep as well?

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2271-0
00:17:06.112 --> 00:17:09.885
Yeah, if I am sleeping in,
someone is playing some music

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2271-1
00:17:09.885 --> 00:17:13.923

phone then definitely it will

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2265-0
00:17:12.992 --> 00:17:13.252

Are there any other factors or
information you think would be

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2315-1
00:17:30.589 --> 00:17:33.885
important for us to consider
when designing an app to promote

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2315-2
00:17:33.885 --> 00:17:35.002

any kind of sleeping sleeping

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2347-1

Things things not to do if you
want to, if you want. If you

c928554e-dc39-4871-abfe-ac50e3aab5ed/2366-0
00:18:02.802 --> 00:18:03.202
Mm-hmm.
