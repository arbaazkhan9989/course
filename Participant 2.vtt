weekends?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/30-0
00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.517
On weekends is normally later.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/47-0
00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:16.856
Or or before we can go like
weekdays, like we can talk about

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/39-0
00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:17.017
OK.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/47-1
00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:18.547
the weekdays and weekends.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/87-0
00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:23.126
On the week days is normally the
schedule has been pretty set and

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/87-1
00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:27.972
tight, so I usually go to sleep
around 11:00 o'clock and wake

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/87-2
00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:30.707

00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:35.477
It has been fixed, but what
happens is if you try to go to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/110-1
00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:39.649

00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:46.093
And then the weekends, because
it is the weekends at the the

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/139-1
00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:51.029
last days of the week, a person
I may go sleep around 1:00 to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/139-2
00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:53.337
1:30 and wake up around 9:00.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/154-0
00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:57.796
And like, can you tell about
like the average time that you

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/154-1
00:00:57.796 --> 00:00:59.537
are having in the weekdays and
weekends?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/190-0
00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:05.191
So I try to keep it pretty
consistent. I I have it is

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/163-0
00:01:00.787 --> 00:01:01.807
I would sleep like.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/190-1
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:09.789
around 8 hours. 8 hours is
enough for me even for both

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/190-2
00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.627
weekends and weekdays.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/192-0
00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:13.327
OK.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/209-0
00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:18.007
So how do you usually feel when
you wake up in the morning? Do

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/209-1
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:19.717
you feel refreshed or tired?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/244-0
00:01:22.987 --> 00:01:27.461
This is this is depends on the
environment my sleep. So

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/244-1
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:32.654
normally I really hope so that I
feel refreshed and happy or but

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/244-2
00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:37.687
lately it has been that I feel
groggy and tired and lethargic.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/246-0
00:01:40.907 --> 00:01:41.197
But.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/249-0
00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:41.757
So.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/261-0
00:01:42.137 --> 00:01:47.069
Yeah, I I I should. It is
normally in the weekdays I would

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/261-1
00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.487
feel.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/270-0
00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:51.528
You're mythologic, but then
weekends I'm I'm pretty

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/270-1
00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.087
refreshed.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/283-0
00:01:54.057 --> 00:01:57.401
And what are some factors that
impact your ability to fall

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/283-1
00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:57.797
asleep?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/356-0
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.745
So the fact that I would say is
doing affecting my is my

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/356-1
00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:08.532
environment because almost
sleeping, I live in a hostel or

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/356-2
00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:12.190
something like a House of
residence. So I'm I don't have

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/356-3
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.168
my bed. It is not my environment
my it is not the temperature

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/356-4
00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:20.147
that I feel that I can change
that I have a better and better

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/356-5
00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:23.934
sleep cycle and the situation
with the light, the incoming

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/356-6
00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:27.848
light from the outside there is
a spotlight right outside my

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/356-7
00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:28.297
window.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/367-0
00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:32.617
Destroys my sleep cycle, so I I
feel that.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/380-0
00:02:33.477 --> 00:02:36.397
And my environment is one of the
major factors contributing to my

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/380-1
00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:36.927
to my sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/383-0
00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:38.147
About sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/398-0
00:02:39.607 --> 00:02:43.557
And like it is it like at times
it's noise or something.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/429-0
00:02:44.517 --> 00:02:49.398
It is not noise. I I'm pretty
resilient to noise, so I'm noisy

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/429-1
00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:54.046
environments do not affect me
that much. It is light light.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/429-2
00:02:54.046 --> 00:02:56.757
Light source does affect my
sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/435-0
00:02:57.957 --> 00:02:59.907
Uh, enlightened temperature do
you mean?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/459-0
00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:04.120
The lights and temperature does
affect my Skype. Yeah, I find

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/447-0
00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:04.127
And.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/459-1
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.536
all comfortable to sleep in a
cold in the environment and

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/459-2
00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:08.537
having a hot bed.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/463-0
00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:10.317
Umm.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/466-0
00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:11.637
Is the ideal.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/470-0
00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:14.927
Thing that I would sleep on.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/481-0
00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:20.075
And what are some the fact like,
what about, like, wake up waking

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/481-1
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:20.257
up?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/493-0
00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:24.437
The fact is that impact your
ability to wake up.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/488-0
00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:22.847
So wake.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/524-0
00:03:27.977 --> 00:03:31.705
The fact is that affect my life.
I wake up. Is it? I wake up

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/524-1
00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:35.494
without noise and I wake up to
my own time and I wake up with

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/524-2
00:03:35.494 --> 00:03:38.977
light. That is another thing. It
must be bright outside.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/538-0
00:03:40.227 --> 00:03:43.650
I mean, what are the factors
like what makes it hard for you

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/538-1
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.267
to wake up?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/547-0
00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:49.227
So that would be that if I
didn't have any.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/555-0
00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:53.127
Proper sleep? I didn't go to REM
sleep or.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/560-0
00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:56.987
It's just that my I.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/585-0
00:03:58.097 --> 00:04:00.875
Yeah, that's the thing. I
haven't gone to. I haven't had

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/585-1
00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.896
proper sleep. I didn't sleep. I
don't relax. That's the thing

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/585-2
00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:04.967
that affects my sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/589-0
00:04:05.747 --> 00:04:06.617
My wake up sleeping.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/603-0
00:04:07.577 --> 00:04:10.661
Have you ever experienced
negative effects of lack of

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/603-1
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:13.516
sleep such as difficulty
concentrating or feeling

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/603-2
00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:14.087
irritable?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/665-0
00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:19.964
Uh, yes, this is one. And this
is one of the things that I've

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/665-1
00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:23.795
been affected. So that goes as
the authority not able to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/665-2
00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:28.163
concentrate, feeling very dull,
not feeling cloudy too. My brain

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/665-3
00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:32.263
is having brain fog accounts,
understanding conversation not

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/665-4
00:04:32.263 --> 00:04:36.228
knowing when I'm going to be
leaving or where I'm going to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/665-5
00:04:36.228 --> 00:04:39.857
and having a bad sense of
direction is one of the few

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/665-6
00:04:39.857 --> 00:04:43.217
things that I say that lack of
sleep does for me.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/684-0
00:04:46.757 --> 00:04:50.659
And have you ever used any
application or technology to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/684-1
00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.117
help improve your sleep habits?
If so, how was your experience?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/689-0
00:04:56.407 --> 00:04:58.227
So I have used.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/697-0
00:05:00.547 --> 00:05:03.597
Some apps, but I would say a
pretty.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/718-0
00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:09.573
Redundant apps too. I use an
alarm to wake up because I find

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/718-1
00:05:09.573 --> 00:05:13.157
that helpful and I would say
having some.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/742-0
00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:19.422
Calm, calm music. Some lofi type
of music. Some ambient noises

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/742-1
00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:23.497
can help me sleep better. White
noise, some white noise.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/756-0
00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:27.482
Gets me to the mood of sleeping.
Yeah, those are the two things

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/747-0
00:05:25.197 --> 00:05:25.457
So.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/755-0
00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:27.387
She like.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/756-1
00:05:27.482 --> 00:05:27.697
that.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/768-0
00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:32.109
Have you tried any application
that you mentioned like like or

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/768-1
00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:32.707
something?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/783-0
00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:39.597
Uh, no, I haven't used any
application as specific to see.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/789-0
00:05:38.517 --> 00:05:41.782
And and technology like, you
know, tracking your sleep

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/789-1
00:05:41.782 --> 00:05:42.197
before.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/875-0
00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:47.549
Uh technology is? Yeah, I have
used variables, watches for one

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/801-0
00:05:43.437 --> 00:05:45.937
Through the like the variables
and, etcetera.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/875-1
00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:51.589
time because to help track my
sleep. And when I go to sleep

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/875-2
00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.965
and you calculate some types and
like if that would be the Apple

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/875-3
00:05:55.965 --> 00:06:00.274
Watch and stuff like that. But
I've not used them since a while

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/875-4
00:06:00.274 --> 00:06:04.179
now it I used them when they
were released, but when they

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/859-0
00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:02.377
And.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/875-5
00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:06.737
were pretty reentry. But I have
left.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/878-0
00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:08.057
Behind.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/891-0
00:06:07.787 --> 00:06:11.117
Was it effective like track to
track your sleep and everything?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/898-0
00:06:09.627 --> 00:06:13.237
Not in. I know it was not Salina
for me.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/905-0
00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:14.957
Alright, OK.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/966-0
00:06:14.347 --> 00:06:18.281
What I would say is that was uh,
it becomes something like a a

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/966-1
00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:22.153
reward thing that ohh you have
sleep 8 hours you have greased

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/966-2
00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:25.774
your goal that was becoming
itself very toxic to me. That

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/966-3
00:06:25.774 --> 00:06:29.583
OK, I'm not reaching that goal
of sleep or not reaching so I

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/966-4
00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:33.517
just completely stopped seeing
those numbers and tracking them

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/966-5
00:06:33.517 --> 00:06:36.077
to just get those things out of
my mind.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/978-0
00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:41.583
Do you have any specific goals
related to improve improving

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/978-1
00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:42.547
your sleep habits?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1027-0
00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:47.801
Uh, some of my goals is me to go
on time to sleep, time

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1027-1
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:51.524
designated to say 10:00.
O'clock. I want to go to sleep

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1027-2
00:06:51.524 --> 00:06:55.114
at 10:00. O'clock. I should
sleep and wake up at 6:00

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1027-3
00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:59.037
o'clock. But I find it pretty.
This is one of my immediate

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1027-4
00:06:59.037 --> 00:07:00.167
goals to fulfill.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1031-0
00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:01.417
While my sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1047-0
00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:07.718
And what we just would you like
to see in an app designed to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1047-1
00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:09.277
promote healthy sleep habits?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1050-0
00:07:13.157 --> 00:07:13.767
So.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1102-0
00:07:14.587 --> 00:07:19.059
One of the things that I find
that it should connect to my

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1102-1
00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:23.833
smart devices on off The thing
is like my LED lines are my LED

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1102-2
00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:28.381
lights, my LED strips so when it
is time to sleep they just

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1102-3
00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:32.397
dumbed down or dull down. Have a
color that is very.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1105-0
00:07:34.377 --> 00:07:34.977
Dark.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1129-0
00:07:35.807 --> 00:07:39.324
So I wouldn't be known that it's
gonna be time to sleep. And when

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1129-1
00:07:39.324 --> 00:07:42.735
it's time to wake up, just go on
full blast. Like, OK, it's the

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1129-2
00:07:42.735 --> 00:07:43.587
morning wake up.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1131-0
00:07:45.417 --> 00:07:45.747
Mm-hmm.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1133-0
00:07:47.647 --> 00:07:48.037
Alright.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1145-0
00:07:48.897 --> 00:07:52.539
And how do you currently wake
up? Is it like alarms that you

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1145-1
00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:52.777
use?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1158-0
00:07:53.857 --> 00:07:57.787
I do use an arm to wake up just.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1159-0
00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:58.607
And do you said like multiple
alarms?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1203-0
00:07:59.207 --> 00:08:02.894
No, no, I do not use this new
feature. I don't set up multiple

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1203-1
00:08:02.894 --> 00:08:06.521
alarms, one arm, one alarm is
enough one. It's just that if I

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1203-2
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.091
don't feel like waking up, I
would just not put the alarm to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1203-3
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:13.894
snooze. I would let keep letting
it run to annoy me, that I need

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1203-4
00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:14.537
to wake up.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1216-0
00:08:15.807 --> 00:08:18.971
And I'd like is the method that
you are using, is it it

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1216-1
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:19.987
effective for you?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1243-0
00:08:20.747 --> 00:08:24.479
Yes, it is effective for me. I
do wake up one time. I do not

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1243-1
00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:28.211
miss my classes. I I do not miss
my schedule passes so it is

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1243-2
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:29.067
enough for me.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1247-0
00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:30.387
Currently.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1273-0
00:08:30.237 --> 00:08:33.394
But what? What do you think?
Like if there is a better alarm,

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1273-1
00:08:33.394 --> 00:08:36.499
like an smart alarm which wakes
you in the light of phase of

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1273-2
00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:39.197
your rim cycle, rather than just
on the random time?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1329-0
00:08:42.257 --> 00:08:45.749
No, I would not prefer that
because those are not random

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1329-1
00:08:45.749 --> 00:08:49.424
times. Those are fixed times
that I need to schedule that I

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1329-2
00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:52.792
need to wake up in any
situation. I need to go on that

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1300-0
00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:51.537
Umm.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1329-3
00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:56.467
time. So even if I'm in there,
I'm sleep. I might miss some

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1329-4
00:08:56.467 --> 00:09:00.326
important event that I have to
attend. I will say that timings

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1329-5
00:09:00.326 --> 00:09:02.837
are usually better to be full to
follow.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1340-0
00:09:03.497 --> 00:09:05.607
A new person may not miss that
event in his life.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1356-0
00:09:06.907 --> 00:09:09.207
Whether that's going to 10:00
o'clock yeah, yeah.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1354-0
00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:08.367
Yeah, so it's like.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1371-0
00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:13.530
Say it's like, you know, we we
get the R.E.M. Cycle for like

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1371-1
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.757
4045 minutes, right?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1373-0
00:09:15.437 --> 00:09:15.927
Yes.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1451-0
00:09:16.017 --> 00:09:19.943
So when you set an alarm, for
example, let's assume 8 in the

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1451-1
00:09:19.943 --> 00:09:23.932
morning, so the the application
will track your sleep and you

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1388-0
00:09:20.677 --> 00:09:20.987
Umm.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1451-2
00:09:23.932 --> 00:09:27.922
know rim cycles it calculate
your R.E.M. Cycles and when like

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1451-3
00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:31.912
you set your goal for eight. So
maybe it can the best time to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1451-4
00:09:31.912 --> 00:09:35.773
for you to wake up was like
7:45. So it'll wake you at 7:45

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1451-5
00:09:35.773 --> 00:09:39.698
in the light of phases of your
R.E.M. Cycle rather than on 8

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1451-6
00:09:39.698 --> 00:09:43.237
when you were in the deeper
phase of the R.E.M. Cycle.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1451-7
00:09:43.237 --> 00:09:45.167
That's what I'm trying to say.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1515-0
00:09:46.197 --> 00:09:50.214
So if one thing that I would say
that if I if my sleep has

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1515-1
00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:54.639
achieved around cycle, if it has
achieved deep deep, it's in the

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1515-2
00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:58.520
second phase is if it has
achieved that I should wake up

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1515-3
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.809
at the lighter cycle. I would
prefer that my alarm goes off at

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1515-4
00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:06.689
the lighter cycle that I have
fulfilled the need I've of

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1515-5
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.867
sleep. I have not overfilled it.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1517-0
00:10:10.337 --> 00:10:10.637
Umm.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1537-0
00:10:12.727 --> 00:10:16.466
How important is it to you to
you to wake up feeling refreshed

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1537-1
00:10:16.466 --> 00:10:18.187
and energized in the morning?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1607-0
00:10:19.257 --> 00:10:23.549
It is very important because it
can just it. It is if it affects

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1607-1
00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:27.576
your decision making, because
sometimes decisions and depend

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1607-2
00:10:27.576 --> 00:10:31.339
on having a person being
energized. Normally a person is

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1607-3
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:35.564
very active in the first hours
of his day. That would be from 8

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1607-4
00:10:35.564 --> 00:10:39.327
to 12, so it would be preferred
that the person is fully

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1607-5
00:10:39.327 --> 00:10:42.627
energized in that time that he
fulfills his task.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1623-0
00:10:44.497 --> 00:10:47.372
All right. And something that
there's something that you like

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1623-1
00:10:47.372 --> 00:10:48.067
to add on that?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1631-0
00:10:50.247 --> 00:10:51.787
I'm pretty OK with that
statement.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1655-0
00:10:52.907 --> 00:10:56.549
Alright. Do you have any
concerns about using technology

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1655-1
00:10:56.549 --> 00:10:59.936
such as machine learning,
artificial intelligence or

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1655-2
00:10:59.936 --> 00:11:03.578
biometric sensors to improve
your sleep? If so, what are

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1655-3
00:11:03.578 --> 00:11:03.897
they?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1685-0
00:11:04.967 --> 00:11:08.566
Well, The thing is, it is pretty
concerning for the use of

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1685-1
00:11:08.566 --> 00:11:12.287
artificial intelligence. It's
the personalized system that a

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1685-2
00:11:12.287 --> 00:11:15.397
person can easily track there.
There's increasing.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1706-0
00:11:15.537 --> 00:11:21.657
The A13 leaks of bitter privacy
and unlike doctors, engineers or

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1706-1
00:11:21.657 --> 00:11:24.857
the data companies, are not
very.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1754-0
00:11:25.287 --> 00:11:29.753
Umm. Be careful for data privacy
so any leaks can cause harm to a

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1754-1
00:11:29.753 --> 00:11:33.948
person, a person. Any bad actors
may know these leaks cycle a

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1754-2
00:11:33.948 --> 00:11:38.142
person living his house at this
time he wakes, he goes up, he

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1754-3
00:11:38.142 --> 00:11:42.202
goes home to sleep. At this time
is a point quite dangerous

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1754-4
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.637
situation if not handled
correctly.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1756-0
00:11:46.047 --> 00:11:46.897
Yeah.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1774-0
00:11:49.857 --> 00:11:53.035
What are some of the challenges
you face when it comes to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1774-1
00:11:53.035 --> 00:11:54.897
maintaining healthy sleep
habits?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1794-0
00:11:56.427 --> 00:12:01.544
Some of the changes that I would
face is my diet, especially so I

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1794-1
00:12:01.544 --> 00:12:04.257
have a pretty bad habit of
taking.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1869-0
00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:08.280
I caffeinated energy drinks or
caffeinated drinks such as

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1869-1
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.385
coffee and tea at late at night
to work on them. And I found

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1869-2
00:12:12.385 --> 00:12:16.355
that after taking them around
6:00 PM or 18 o'clock it has

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1869-3
00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:20.527
been very difficult to go to
sleep. But it designated time of

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1869-4
00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:24.430
10 to 12 because the energy is
still lasts and it, and if

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1869-5
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.602
you're not doing anything, those
things lead you to invite in

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1869-6
00:12:28.602 --> 00:12:32.909
stressful stress, which causes
again raising thoughts or racing

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1869-7
00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:34.187
thoughts that that.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1873-0
00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:35.297
Further caused them.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1895-0
00:12:36.477 --> 00:12:39.361
And then like in a negative
feedback loop type of system,

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1895-1
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:42.245
that and further cause bad
thoughts that the person might

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1895-2
00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:43.587
find it difficult to sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1907-0
00:12:45.287 --> 00:12:48.437
And do you consider like the
social pressures in that thing

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1907-1
00:12:48.437 --> 00:12:48.857
as well?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1917-0
00:12:51.327 --> 00:12:54.467
So no, I I do not consider
social pressures.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1926-0
00:12:54.547 --> 00:12:57.257
And because because the person.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1938-0
00:12:56.417 --> 00:12:59.959
Social pressure, as in like your
friends, you know, keeping you

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1938-1
00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:01.287
stay awake or something.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1967-0
00:13:02.727 --> 00:13:06.544
I'm I'm at the age that I find
it adamant that I if I'm going

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1967-1
00:13:06.544 --> 00:13:10.484
to sleep, I need to go sleep. I
I don't find being pressured to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1967-2
00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:12.577
go as deep as say later at
night.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1985-0
00:13:13.447 --> 00:13:16.567
I would be more to my own
choice, but I don't. I don't

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1975-0
00:13:14.037 --> 00:13:14.357
Umm.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/1985-1
00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:17.417
feel pressured.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2004-0
00:13:17.517 --> 00:13:21.672
Uh, it was. This is a set time.
This is my own personal time and

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2004-1
00:13:21.672 --> 00:13:24.867
I would like to eat by myself
with no one around.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2012-0
00:13:25.827 --> 00:13:27.887
So this is pretty serious thing
for me.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2035-0
00:13:29.427 --> 00:13:33.267
Can you tell me a time? Can you
tell me about a time when you

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2035-1
00:13:33.267 --> 00:13:37.231
had a particularly good night's
sleep? What factors contributed

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2035-2
00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:38.407
to that experience?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2040-0
00:13:42.407 --> 00:13:43.617
So it would be.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2047-0
00:13:44.447 --> 00:13:46.677
Between my undergrad and grad
days.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2111-0
00:13:47.537 --> 00:13:51.853
I was just. I'm I I have no
studies to follow. I I'm I had I

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2111-1
00:13:51.853 --> 00:13:56.169
am alone in my own room. I have
my own bed. I can set my own

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2111-2
00:13:56.169 --> 00:14:00.414
temperature. No ones gonna
disturb me. No one is at home. I

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2111-3
00:14:00.414 --> 00:14:05.012
have no social pressures. Would
be a time in my life that I find

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2111-4
00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:06.427
that I had the best.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2112-0
00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:08.407
So.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2137-0
00:14:08.487 --> 00:14:12.122
Would do you say like like
akhilan academic pressure? It's

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2137-1
00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:15.941
like the one of the contributors
in like making the making it

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2137-2
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:17.727
hard for the people to sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2162-0
00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:21.821
Yes, I do consider academic
pressures, especially the time

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2162-1
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:25.502
of exams and assignments. Dear
is one of the things that caused

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2162-2
00:14:25.502 --> 00:14:26.077
bad sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2164-0
00:14:27.827 --> 00:14:28.187
Alright.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2174-0
00:14:30.057 --> 00:14:32.747
Do you share your bed with a
partner or roommate?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2178-0
00:14:34.137 --> 00:14:34.927
No, I do not.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2181-0
00:14:36.327 --> 00:14:36.697
Right.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2235-0
00:14:36.797 --> 00:14:40.817
And I do not prefer to share a
person a bed with the new one. I

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2187-0
00:14:37.397 --> 00:14:37.747
But.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2235-1
00:14:40.817 --> 00:14:44.523
would prefer to sleep alone
because, you know, you may not

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2208-0
00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:43.007
And.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2235-2
00:14:44.523 --> 00:14:48.543
have your own leg space or your
own sharing of your own sheets.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2235-3
00:14:48.543 --> 00:14:51.935
So I would prefer to sleep
alone, even if I do have a

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2235-4
00:14:51.935 --> 00:14:52.437
partner.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2269-0
00:14:54.147 --> 00:14:58.112
So like as you were talking, so
can you describe more of the

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2269-1
00:14:58.112 --> 00:15:02.207
impacts that it'll have on your
sleep if you do share your bed

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2269-2
00:15:02.207 --> 00:15:04.287
with your partner or a roommate?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2322-0
00:15:04.957 --> 00:15:09.161
So one of the few things that I
currently consider is like the

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2322-1
00:15:09.161 --> 00:15:13.030
person's snoring, the persons
own body heat, having being

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2322-2
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.167
aware that they're the person
right next to you, he may judge

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2322-3
00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:21.370
you for your actions itself is
anxiety inducing. It is anxious

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2322-4
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.439
state condition. So I would
consider that having being alone

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2322-5
00:15:25.439 --> 00:15:27.307
is a better option to sleep.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2324-0
00:15:28.597 --> 00:15:28.937
Right.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2355-0
00:15:29.587 --> 00:15:33.207
Are there any other factors or
information you think you would

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2355-1
00:15:33.207 --> 00:15:36.941
be important for us to consider
when designing an app to promote

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2355-2
00:15:36.941 --> 00:15:38.147
healthy sleep habits?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2376-0
00:15:44.997 --> 00:15:50.079
Currently I was saying the
ambiance of the app. The sounds

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2376-1
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:52.577
that it make connect with or.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2382-0
00:15:53.657 --> 00:15:54.507
A support.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2464-0
00:15:55.217 --> 00:15:59.110
That a person does not have
enough sleep, what he can do to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2464-1
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.262
improve his sleep or just talk
with someone is something that I

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2464-2
00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:07.414
would consider the person that
the app has. Consider that if if

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2464-3
00:16:07.414 --> 00:16:11.112
the person has not has enough
sleep, what he could do to

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2464-4
00:16:11.112 --> 00:16:15.199
improve his sleep, what options
he can seek for his own health

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2464-5
00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:18.961
and mental health can be one
option that I would consider

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2464-6
00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:21.037
that a person the app considers.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2466-0
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:21.997
For.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2482-0
00:16:23.597 --> 00:16:26.974
And what about waking up? Like
what factors? And you know,

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2482-1
00:16:26.974 --> 00:16:29.377
information you think would be
important?

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2500-0
00:16:30.147 --> 00:16:34.114
To like for us to consider when
designing an app to like wake

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2500-1
00:16:34.114 --> 00:16:35.137
them up on time.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2513-0
00:16:37.507 --> 00:16:41.063
Or in a better manner like that,
they feel energized or

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2513-1
00:16:41.063 --> 00:16:41.697
refreshed.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2531-0
00:16:45.767 --> 00:16:50.242
That is a difficult question, I
would say, but what I would

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2531-1
00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:54.567
consider is that, uh, some
seeing about habits of person.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2546-0
00:16:55.427 --> 00:16:59.522
With healthy habits like taking
breakfast on time after waking

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2546-1
00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:00.757
up or just sitting.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2562-0
00:17:02.007 --> 00:17:05.606
Waking up and sitting for few a
few minutes just to collect your

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2562-1
00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:06.657
thoughts. Thoughts.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2588-0
00:17:09.307 --> 00:17:12.513
Is when I have to come things I
would consider, but I can't say

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2588-1
00:17:12.513 --> 00:17:14.967
for waking up as strongly as I
can for sleeping.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2587-0
00:17:13.977 --> 00:17:14.577
Alright, alright.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2601-0
00:17:16.727 --> 00:17:19.540
Do you have any questions or
would you like to add anything

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2601-1
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.617

Uh.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2607-0
00:17:24.017 --> 00:17:24.897
No, I'm pretty.

d8f417d1-1aa4-4082-9dc8-5b30cbdb0ac0/2619-0
00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:29.351
Sure of my statements and now

00:17:29.351 --> 00:17:30.627
would add anything else.
